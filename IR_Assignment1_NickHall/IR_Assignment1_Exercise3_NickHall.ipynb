            "Agatha Christie Poirot, I said. I have been thinking. An admirable exercise my friend. Continue it. \n",
            "Agatha Christie Instinct is a marvelous thing. It can neither be explained nor ignored.\n",
            "Agatha Christie The best time for planning a book is while you're doing the dishes. \n",
            "Agatha Christie You gave too much rein to your imagination. Imagination is a good servant, and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.\n",
            "Agatha Christie It is really a hard life. Men will not be nice to you if you are not good-looking, and women will not be nice to you if you are.\n",
            "Agatha Christie Good advice is always certain to be ignored, but that's no reason not to give it. \n",
            "Agatha Christie The truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and beautiful to seekers after it.\n",
            "Agatha Christie A man when he is making up to anybody can be cordial and gallant and full of little attentions and altogether charming. But when a man is really in love he can't help looking like a sheep.\n",
            "Agatha Christie It's like all those quiet people, when they do lose their tempers they lose them with a vengeance.\n",
            "Agatha Christie They tried to be too clever---and that was their undoing.\n",

            "Arthur Conan Doyle There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle Watson. Come at once if convenient. If inconvenient, come all the same.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle My mind, he said, rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle There are always some lunatics about. It would be a dull world without them.\n",

            "Arthur Conan Doyle Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?' 'To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.' 'The dog did nothing in the night-time.' 'That was the curious incident,' remarked Sherlock Holmes. \n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle It's quite exciting, said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn.\n",
            "Arthur Conan Doyle To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen.... And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n",
